STEP 1: PLOT OF PERMEATE FLUX (J_w) VS. TRANSMEMBRANE PRESSURE (ΔP)

A. Purpose:
- To understand how water flux (J_w) through the RO membrane depends on the applied pressure.

B. Theoretical Basis:
- Permeate flux increases with pressure according to:
    J_w = K_w(ΔP − Δπ)
- In this step, you’re plotting J_w vs. ΔP (raw pressure), not yet correcting for osmotic pressure.

C. What to Plot:
- x-axis: ΔP (Transmembrane Pressure) [Units: bar or kPa]
- y-axis: J_w (Water flux) [Units: L/m²·h]

D. Data Processing:
- Calculate J_w for each pressure condition:
   J_w = V / (A × t)
   where:
     V = volume of permeate collected (L)
     A = membrane area (m²)
     t = time (h)

E. What to Look For:
- A roughly linear increase in J_w with ΔP.
- If slope is consistent across different salts/concentrations, membrane performance is stable.
- Non-linearity could suggest membrane saturation, fouling, or concentration polarization.

F. Tips:
- Label each curve based on salt and concentration.
- Use separate plots for each salt & concentration combination.
- Include error bars on flux (based on volume & time measurement uncertainty).

STEP 2: CORRECTED FLUX AND SALT FLUX PLOTS (USE OF SOLUTION DIFFUSION MODEL)

A. Goal:
- Plot J_w vs. (ΔP − Δπ) to determine water permeability coefficient K_w.
- Plot J_s vs. Δc_s to determine salt permeability coefficient K_s.

B. Key Equations:
- Water flux: J_w = K_w(ΔP − Δπ)
- Salt flux: J_s = K_sΔc_s

C. What to Plot:

1. J_w vs. (ΔP − Δπ)
   - x-axis: Effective Pressure = (ΔP − Δπ) [bar]
   - y-axis: J_w (Water flux) [L/m²·h]
   - The slope = K_w (water permeability coefficient)

2. J_s vs. Δc_s
   - x-axis: Δc_s = c_feed − c_permeate [g/L or mol/L]
   - y-axis: J_s (Salt flux) [g/m²·h or mol/m²·h]
   - Calculate salt flux:
      J_s = (mass of salt in permeate) / (A × t)

D. Data Requirements:
- Osmotic pressure (π) calculation:
   π = i × c × R × T
   - i = van’t Hoff factor (e.g., 2 for NaCl, 3 for MgSO₄)
   - c = molar concentration [mol/L]
   - R = 0.08314 L·bar/mol·K
   - T = temperature [K]

- For salt flux (J_s), measure:
   - EC of permeate → convert to concentration using your calibration curve
   - Calculate mass of salt passed → use volume × c_permeate

E. What to Look For:
- A linear relationship confirms solution-diffusion behavior.
- Slopes (K_w and K_s) represent membrane performance.
- Compare K_w and K_s across salts and concentrations.

F. Tips:
- Keep units consistent (e.g., L, m², h).
- Use linear regression with R² to evaluate fit quality.
- Include all individual data points (don’t average them), and add best-fit line.

---------------------------------------------

STEP 3: MODEL COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF OSMOTIC EFFECTS

A. Purpose:
- To determine if osmotic pressure significantly affects water transport.
- To compare experimental data with theoretical predictions (solution-diffusion model).

B. Comparison of Two Plots:
1. J_w vs. ΔP:
   - Shows raw relationship of water flux to pressure.
   - May appear linear, but ignores osmotic backpressure.

2. J_w vs. (ΔP − Δπ):
   - Corrects for osmotic pressure.
   - Should give a more accurate representation of membrane behavior.
   - If this line is more linear and passes closer to origin, confirms solution-diffusion model.

C. Salt Flux Validation:
- J_s vs. Δc_s should be linear if salt transport is diffusive.
- Significant deviations may imply:
   - Polarization effects
   - Membrane selectivity limits
   - Experimental error in EC measurements

D. Questions to Ask:
- Does correcting for Δπ change the slope significantly?
- Does J_w appear more consistent after Δπ correction?
- Are salt fluxes linear and consistent with theory?
- How do K_w and K_s compare between NaCl and MgSO₄?
  (Divalent salts usually show lower K_s due to higher rejection)

E. Qualitative Observations:
- If NaCl has higher J_s than MgSO₄ → expected due to monovalent nature.
- If J_w decreases at high salt concentrations → osmotic pressure is limiting flux.

F. Quantitative Analysis:
- Report values of K_w and K_s from best-fit lines.
- Compare trends across the 4 test conditions (2 salts × 2 concentrations).
- Discuss any outliers or unexpected slopes in light of possible fouling or concentration polarization.

---------------------------------------------

UNITS QUICK REFERENCE:
- Water flux (J_w): L/m²·h
- Salt flux (J_s): g/m²·h or mol/m²·h
- EC: µS/cm or mS/cm
- Concentration: g/L or mol/L
- Osmotic pressure (π): bar
- Pressure (ΔP): bar
- Permeation Coefficients:
   - K_w: L/m²·h·bar⁻¹
   - K_s: g/m²·h·(g/L)⁻¹ or mol/m²·h·(mol/L)⁻¹

---------------------------------------------

TIPS:
- Use distinct plot markers or line styles for each salt/concentration.
- Include legends and labeled axes for clarity.
- Discuss which model fits best and why.
- Highlight how your data confirms or challenges the expected behavior of the membrane.
